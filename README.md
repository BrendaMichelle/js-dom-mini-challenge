## Assignment

Today, we'll be building a prototype of a small application about Raffy's trip to the Amazon Rainforest. If you're so inclined to do so, feel free to change the data and personalize your app!

There's a section in this Readme file for your notes on each deliverable. As you go through the deliverables, write down some notes in this file on how you solved each problem. It'll help reinforce what you learned and give you a head start next time you see a similar problem.

A note on notation: when you see an element like `h1#header` in the Readme, that refers to the element's tag name and the CSS selector. For example, `h1#header` looks like this in the HTML:

```html
<h1 id="header">Some text here</h1>
```

And `div.traveler` looks like this (note the CSS class selector syntax):

```html
<div class="traveler">
  <!-- child elements here -->
</div>
```
___________

## Deliverable 1

Open the `index.html` file in your browser and check the console in Chrome Dev Tools. You'll notice the console.log from line 2 of the `index.js` file is returning `null` instead of showing the `h1#header` element.

Figure out what you need to change to give Javascript access to the `h1#header` element.

**YOUR NOTES**
```
In your index.html you have to use defer to make sure your script loads after your <body> does.

```
___________

## Deliverable 2

Now that you have access to the `h1#header` element, use Javascript to change the element's font color to your favorite color.

**YOUR NOTES**
```
To change the color all you have to do is go into the variable you just made, go into it's stlye with dot notation, and go into it's color, then set that color equal to, =, the color you would like.
```
___________

## Deliverable 3

Now that we've got a beautiful header, we can show some traveler data on the page. The traveler data is stored in a variable called `traveler` in the `data.js` file - you can still access that variable in your `index.js` file (see if you can figure out why!).

First, uncomment the `console.log` under Deliverable 3 in the `index.js` file to see the data in the console. 

Using the `traveler` object, update the DOM to show the traveler's *name*, *nickname*, and *photo* in the appropriate places. For the `<img>` tag, make sure to update the `src` attribute *and* the `alt` attribute (it's important for accessibility).

**YOUR NOTES**
```
I believe you are able to access 'data.js' because it is called on before 'index.js' in the index.html head.

As for updating, I selected the elements that I wanted to update and set them as variables, then I changed the innerText for the the ones that were just html, and for the image I changed the source and the alt by setting them equal to the object of traveler and using dot notation to select the attribute from traveler I needed.
```
___________

## Deliverable 4

We also want to show some of the awesome animal sightings our traveler had. You'll notice that within the `traveler` object, there's an `animalSightings` property that contains an array of animal sighting data. *For each* of the animal sightings, create a DOM element that looks like this and add it to the `ul#animals`:

```js
<li data-id="{animalSighting id}">
  <p>{animal sighting description}</p>
  <img src="{animal sighting photo}" alt="{animal sighting species}"/>
  <a href="{animal sighting link}" target="_blank">Here's a video about the {animal sighting species} species!</a>
</li>
```

**YOUR NOTES**
```
So here I decided to use forEach on the array in traveler.animalSightings, so that at each index of the array it would make a new <li> element with a specific data-id, then for the innerHTML specified each value and before ending the iteration I appended the <ul> in the body by adding the list item we just created.
```

**NOTE**: The `data-id` attribute is a custom property known as a "dataset attribute". They're useful for adding additional data to the DOM that doesn't have any effect on CSS of what the user sees - they're purely meant as tools for Javascript developers. We'll use this `data-id` attribute in the next deliverable.

For more info on `data-*` attributes, have a look at this [MDN article on using dataset attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes)

___________

## Deliverable 5

Ruh-oh! Another traveler's animal sighting has snuck into our list. While it's certainly a great sighting, it doesn't belong on the list with the rest of Raffy's animal sightings. 

Since you gave each `<li>` a `data-id` attribute in the last deliverable, we can use that information to find the animal sighting we're looking for. 

Use Javascript to find the element with the `[data-id='3']` attribute, and *remove* that element from the page.

> Hint: You can use `querySelector` with [CSS Attribute Selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors) to find an element with a specific data-id. 

**YOUR NOTES**
```
Trying to use querySelector to find the specific li was diffiult but then using the the css attribute selector was a big help. after I located the item all I had to do was use .remove() to remove it from the page.
```
